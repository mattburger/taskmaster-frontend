# Static Frontend for TaskMaster
## Overview
- JSON is cool and all, but humans struggle with understanding it. Let’s admit our human failings by creating a web frontent with React to view this data in a more user-friendly way.

## Features
- A user should be able to visit the homepage of your React app and see the list of all tasks available in the database.
- React should be well-factored into at least 2 components.
- The homepage should have reasonable styling and layout. (Nothing too fancy, but it shouldn’t make the user cringe.)
- A user should be able to find that homepage on the Internet, deployed as a static site using S3.
